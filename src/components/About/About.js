<p>Ans:ReactJS Router is mainly used for developing Single <br />
 Page Web Applications. React Router is used to define multiple <br />
  routes in the application. When a user types a specific URL into the browser, <br />
   and if this URL path matches any 'route' inside the router file, the user will be <br />
    redirected to that particular route.</p>
